# Simple Web Scraper

## How to run locally

Run 'npm install' or 'yarn install' to install dependencies

Run 'node <file_name>' to run the scraper e.g. 'node ebay.js'. Running 'node ebay.js' will output the results to a generated csv file (ebay.csv), which you may use to analyze the data. Note however, that only a csv file is generated only if you run 'node ebay.js' and not 'node bella.js'. Running the latter will output results to the console.

Cheers!
